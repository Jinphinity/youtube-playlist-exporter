# GASP ALS Replicated & Updated to UE 5.5 - Free Unreal Project on GitHub (20241120)

hello everyone and welcome to the gasp ALS 5.5 project update so as you guys know epic has released the 5.5 stable and with it uh Caleb Mong and the guys at Epic have released an update to the game animation sample so the gasp ALS project was due for a for an update so I was planning to wait a little bit before doing the update because I wanted to integrate some more things but a lot of you in the comments have gotten a bit impatient so I decided to do the project

update first and then I will bring the other features later on so first of all we're going to go into some of the features that were added uh to the gasp 5.5 version so the first thing is Crouch now is supported and has the turn in place and has all the animations necessary which is super cool and they also added a Sprint so now the character can Sprint so these are for the animation part now they also have um added a state machine setup so it's a

setup that uses a lot less animations than it's set up with a state machine and you can just enable it and disable it by clicking here and in the characters you can also see both the state machine and the motion matching setup working next to each other so if you want to compare the state machine is using less than 400 animations and the motion matching is over 800 so from what I'm seeing here like the results of the state machine one is are really good for the amount of animations it's using so

it almost there's almost no difference and it looks really cool so if some of you guys don't like motion matching or find it too hard you have the state machine setup now that you can use um another uh feature that they added is it's now replicated and I think that's it for uh for the 5.5 uh update so now we're going to get into to the gasp ALS updates so the first

thing uh of course is that gasp ALS is now working with the overlay system that we had so everything is working as before all the states now working in Crouch as well the items all the stuff that we had before is now working in 5.5 uh I had some um things to tweak so basically gas

Alis was already set up for Crouch and Sprint so for some of you that ported the project themselves uh it's actually was working but there were some issues for example when sprinting the legs were acting a bit finicky so I went into the the um curves and I updated that stuff so that it looks good um of course I also replicated the overlay States so if you guys are using the overlay states in the gas pay you will see that that they

are actually replicated so everything is working fine everything is replicated there are some uh issues I don't know if they were already in the project or not but as you can see here like ik is not the best uh I'm still trying to find some ual fixes for those things because in the previous project they were just basically Band-Aid fixes but I'm trying to have like a proper

retargeting system for for the ik and everything so for for you guys to know I I did not Port the previous project to 5.5 I actually created the new gasp on 5.5 and then I ported everything that I did into it and that way um the project is really has all the new little tweaks and things that they did on gas 5.5 so it has the thread safe setup and it has some some additional fixes and things that they did so I went ahead and ported

everything that I did before to a new gas project so that I don't miss on anything that they've already done so I have some other updates coming the first one is going to be finding proper workflow for the uh hand attachments so for the object attachment I want to find something really robust uh right now now we're we're using a an additive layer to the weapon R which basically uh we're setting up the weapon R um bone here

with an additive layer so that the items are properly set up we can also use a socket instead of this and attach to a socket um but I want to find a way to do this uh properly so and I uh also want to find a way to fix an issue where if we go into the like we pick up another character we can see that when we attach things they are not attached properly and why this is happening this is happening because the gun is actually attached to the ufn

manin it's not attached to the uh uv5 skeleton right now so one way to do it would be to attach directly to the u5 skeleton but I want to find a better way to do this so that it's actually um also robust and works for pretty much any case I'm still uh going to research those keep in mind guys that I'm working on this project only on the weekends I'm very very busy with work right now but I'll try to get something good uh to work here and some other minor updates that I want to do I wanted to do um ik

but the guys went and did it for us so thank you uh epic and thank you Caleb uh I want to add Dynamic um traversal so I want to be able to uh basically Traverse any um obstacles without them being set as traversable so uh the guys at Epic already included um ledge catches so now if you jump from here you can actually catch it if you

play the game correctly let me try again we'll give it a little Sprint and no that one is too far anyways we can uh we can try it from this one if we go in the right direction again thank you so now we can ledge grab so they already did this what I want to do is basically make the system Dynamic so that we can actually climb on

anything there are some guys on Twitter and on YouTube that did that I will just take some of those and I will credit them and I will add it to the project because I feel like that's something that would be nice to have and then like I said we'll add rag do in and uh we'll see where we go from there I want to keep the project simple so that we don't like um bloat it with a lot of stuff I wanted to keep it mostly related to Locomotion so some of you guys have asked for some features like horse

riding and things like that I'm not planning to do that those things in in this project but if you make a version of guest Al that has those things please feel free to share with the community someone will find that useful but yeah I want to keep this project really just uh about Locomotion so that it's can be used by anyone and then people can develop onp top of it so that's it for this update I hope you guys enjoyed it uh more updates will be coming in the future and see you guys in the next videos
