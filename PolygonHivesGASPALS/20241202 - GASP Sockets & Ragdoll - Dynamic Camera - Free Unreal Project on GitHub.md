# GASP Sockets & Ragdoll - Dynamic Camera - Free Unreal Project on GitHub (20241202)

hello everyone welcome to another gasp ALS project update so first of all I fixed the uh hand attachment issues so no matter what character you have now the things are going to attach correctly um the ik is not working yet I need to have a better system for that but the items were uh are going to uh attach correctly no matter what character you're using so basically I switched from uh using the weapon R and weapon L to using

basically sockets that are on each character so the sockets are not perfectly adjusted for each character so I did not spend time to adjust all the sockets on all the characters um but you can adjust them themselves depending on what Char what character you're using or the character that is for your game so uh the way it's done is um if you go uh into a specific character so here if we go for example to the u4 mannequin and rigs

actually meshes and skeleton you will see that he has uh an overlay socket for each of the items and this is the case for basically every single character so um keep in mind guide that this is not maybe for all the projects it's it's really dependent on your project so F first things first like if you have a project that you have only one character in your game then you're basically not supposed suppos to use uh runtime

retargeting you're not supposed to use the system which basically copies the post pose from the previous uh character to this one so if your if your project has only one character then you better just like retarget the animation blueprint or rig your character to the ufn mannequin and just just use that so this the runtime retargeting system is used for projects like fortnite or something where they have a lot of uh characters but if you are not uh using uh different characters in your project

then you're not supposed to to use uh runtime retargeting uh the second thing is I made a quick system which basically makes it so even if you have multiple characters and you attach a weapon like you will see the weapon attached to all of them so this is a system where basically it um checks in the uh here if you go into the uh Blueprints and the not the main character but actually retargeted characters you will see that the meshes that I want to attach the

um overlay item to I tag them with a attach overlay item tag here and then uh in the uh main character blueprint in the overlay system like when we start the game I get all the meses that are tagged with this and then when we attach an item to the hand first of all I attach the main item which is the um the one that is parented to the health root object and then I spawn basically items dynamically for each mesh that has that

Tech so this way when you're playing even if you have like three characters you can do the bow and you can spawnable for all of them and then you can see how it behaves on each of these characters so again this is a debug thing this is not how games are supposed to be made uh when you're making a game you're supposed to basically um have a inventory system that is spting instances of your items and attaching them correctly so this is this is a Locomotion project guys so uh don't uh

be very don't go too deep into this attach into different characters and stuff it really depends on the game that you're making and solve the issue for your game and not for for a project like this I'm solving these issues so that you guys can test but if the solution is not perfect or the sockets are not perfectly align keep in mind that this is for demonstration purposes and this is not meant to be used the this entire um the overlay system in in and of itself can be used in your final game

but this entire system of switching like the que button uh the queue button to switch overlays and this is not an inventory system this is basically just spawning items and and like changing the overlay so uh in a proper game you're supposed to basically be um using your inventory system to do these things uh instead of just uh uh like relying on this code that is in the base character so um this is fixed I also fixed the ragad dolls now on um the

retargeted characters so now if you Ragdoll on each character you will not see that Jitter that was there before so the ragdolls uh are working for any character that that basically you're you're playing so it was just a TI group thing so basically the way this is fixed is if you go to retargeted character here and you select the the mesh and you have tick here these tick were set to pre physics and now they are set to post physics and it works uh this is thanks to uh an issue that was opened on the

git GitHub project and a person from the community answered with the with this response and I tried it and it's work and another quick feature that I added is basically shoulder switching when you're uh strafing so if you hit left alt you will see that the character is going to switch uh to the left or right shoulder and of course this only works if you are uh in strafe mode so if you are not in strafe mode it's not going to work but then when you're strafin it's it's going to

function uh all right so that's it for uh the updates
