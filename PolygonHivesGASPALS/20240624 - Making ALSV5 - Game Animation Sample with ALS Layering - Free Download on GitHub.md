# Making ALSV5 - Game Animation Sample with ALS Layering - Free Download on GitHub (20240624)

hello everyone and welcome to this new video where we're going to talk about the game animation sample it's all over the internet as most of you guys know Caleb longm the creator of advanced Locomotion system is now working with epic and has released a new Locomotion project which is using motion matching and it's pretty cool and everyone is talking about it so I wanted to talk about it a little bit as well and show you guys what I've been doing with it these last two weekends so uh before we

start like Caleb longm is the creator of advanced Locomotion system for those who don't know Advanced Loc otion system it's basically the most advanced Locomotion system in unreal and it was a bit too complicated for most people to get in because it it had a lot of feature Caleb definitely went for uh quality over Simplicity for this project he really wanted to make everything perfect and it ended up being a bit too complicated but uh a lot of projects have used it and it's really really

awesome and one of the big um advantages of advanced Locomotion system is the layering system so it basically allows you to layer poses on top of The Locomotion uh which for people that are not uh animators like me it is really cool to be able to just do this with with poses and for example the Lyra project which uh did not have a layering system it had like an entire animation set for each weapon and if you are

working on solo projects or small teams and you don't have a lot of animators it's going to be pretty complicated to make all those animations for each weapon so uh the issue is with the game animation sample is that it released without a layering system so or without any system to have to equip weapons or to equip items and that's what I've been trying to do this uh this last two weekends so I've been extracting the layering system from uh alss and basically plug in it on top of the uh uh

game animation sample it is working pretty well there are some issues but it's overall I managed to um extract most of it and like plug it in here uh I also uh pluged the uh work in progress Crouch animations that came with the sample KB showed how to do that in the Stream with the other epic developers and everything is working pretty fine like with aim offsets and everything and it's looking like we will be able to completely plug the um the layering

system from ALS on top of this I basically see the game animation sample as aless V5 so for those who've been following ALS there's been four versions the first second third and the fourth one is the one that had the the layering system so basically this is going to turn into Alis V5 with the community and probably Caleb's update as well uh they mentioned in the live stream that they uh they have some pretty cool layering uh features that they are trying to productize and put into the uh the

engine um those features are for now probably still internal to Epic so while we wait for those I will be working on extracting the entire ALS layering system and plugging it into the game animation sample and I will make this available to all of you guys so if you are interested uh don't forget to subscribe I will put all of this into uh into a GitHub project so that you guys can be able to um use the game animation

sample in your projects and have weapons and have items similar to How We Were Us in advanced Loc motion system before so um the way I'm doing this is I basically put everything inside a um linked layer so I have this linked layer which basically I extracted the layering system from ALS and I'm basically doing the blending the same way ALS was doing it and the only thing that is added to

the um game animation sample project is this node in here so I'm trying to do this in a non-destructive way to the game animation sample I'm trying to change as least uh things as possible so that we can easily Port this to the new updates of the um the game animation sample when they finish working on Crouch and Sprint and they if they add some some other features I want to keep those so I'm trying to put everything in a good modular way so that we can use that uh the system also still uses the

um the the curves so so basically in each pose we have the curves that Define how much we want to blend the arms the legs and all of these so this was something really really good in ALS I really liked it so I wanted to keep it um I did some changes so basically now there isn't a single animation with all the poses this is this is the animation that came with ALS I split that into different poses just because I prefer to work with single poses rather than um

one sing animation with a a bunch of keys in uh in the curves uh I also like I said made this a an anim layer with an anim layer interface so uh we have the base layer which is in here which does the blending and then we have the child classes where we Define all these poses so basically we just can create different um child classes of that uh linked layer so this is the one

for the pistol one hand we can Define all the poses here and then when we link it to the character so for now I'm just linking it straight uh on the begin play but this is supposed to be done for example by your inventory system where you equip a different item and then you link the layer that is um uh that corresponds to that item and then it will automatically update this uh also in in ALS like the um the overlay poses were all in here so so we had like

weapon one hand weapon two hands rifle everything I made these variables so now we have these states relax ready and aiming and then depending on the link layer that you will um link it will have its own poses so this way uh we don't have everything uh hardly referenced in in here so I am still working on this I am going to Port most of the layers from ALS so uh all the um all these layers that you can see here most of them not

all of them but I I at least want to post the um Port the weapons uh the bow the torch these kind of things that could be interesting to see because some of them are using the left hand some of some of them are using two hands with ik so I need to work the ik in um I will work on these I will try to clean up everything there are some also some interesting things so for example here uh you can see that the legs once you release they will do like a kind of nice transition so they don't just blend in

they they kind of move that's an ALS called the dynamic transition I want to Port that as well um then plug some good ik for the hands and for the feet and basically we'll have alv5 so I will still work on that uh mostly on my free time in the weekends and I will be putting all of that stuff uh up on the internet for you guys to play with so uh like I said if it's not yet the case uh don't forget to subscribe to the channel so that you stay tuned and you get it when it's done

and please uh if you like the video like it it helps a lot and see you guys in the next video
